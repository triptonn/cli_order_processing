A lightweight command line interface business management system built in pure Python, demonstrating practical implementation of enterprise software concepts without external dependencies. The system handles customer relationships, order processing, and inventory management through a command-line interface.

## Features
- Customer relationship management
- Order processing with multi-item support
- Basic inventory tracking
- User authentication
- CSV-based data persistence
- In-memory caching for performance

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No additional packages required

Run the application:

> python main.py

## Development Status
This project is developed as a version of a training exercise at school to refresh Python programming capabilities and look what i can produce in about a work week. It serves as a practical example of building business software with minimal dependencies while trying to maintain a ordered code base. 

Currently in active development with core functionality mostly implemented, a simple authentication in the works and ongoing optimization work.
